    <p>Lions are symbols of strength and courage and have been celebrated throughout history for these characteristics. </p>
       <p>They are also common symbols for royalty and stateliness, hence the phrase 'king of the jungle'. </p>
        <p>Ancient Egyptians venerated lions as their war dieties due to their strength, power and fierceness.</p>
